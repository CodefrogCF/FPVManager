# Change summary

## 2026-11-10

- Prevented an empty globe after transient terrain-root failures; startup now
  validates and reuses all required roots and retries twice in the background.
- Disabled Windows route snapshots of the live WebView2 texture to prevent a
  native engine crash when opening saved places after selecting a map point.
- Added temporary terrain-refinement relief during fast turns and low-altitude
  streaming stalls, with staged restoration of normal detail.
- Included long in-flight frame pauses in opt-in performance diagnostics.
- Fixed blank grey coordinate fields on first expansion of the BAKOM,
  forest-fire prevention and dated-imagery panels, and constrained long imagery
  collection labels on narrow screens.
- Adopted Apache-2.0 for original project material; preserved separate software,
  data and service rights and the additional notices bundled by dependencies.
- Consolidated and refreshed user/developer documentation and in-app help.
- Removed development-ticket references and superseded documentation.

## 2026-11-09

- Grouped map/globe controls in **Karte & Ansicht**; shortened navigation and
  simulator menus and moved secondary details into expandable sections.
- Replaced verbose map credits with a compact sources control while retaining
  full notices and required visible provider attributions.
- Removed legacy tunnel-axis overlays and surface exploration controls;
  automatic 3D tunnels and their internal source catalogue remain available.
- Stabilized long-tunnel handoffs, portal heights and underground junctions.
  Portal openings preserve roads; tunnel walls render opaque from both sides.
- Added schematic bridge supports using mapped or verified native deck data.
- Reduced tunnel-build and depth-query bursts; large render stalls no longer
  produce large simulation catch-up movements.

Synthetic fixtures and desktop measurements do not establish Android frame rate,
surveyed tunnel geometry, real-world obstacle clearance or permission to fly.
